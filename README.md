# NewportDataProject.github.io

This is the repository for the GitHub pages site for the Newport Data
Project.

We're running this as an open project, so feel free to fork the
repository and build up the site.

GitHub supports [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) natively,
~~so the current plan is to get the site set up using it, instead of
hand-coded html.~~ but we don't need a complicated site to get started,
so html with css styling and javascript functions is just fine for now.

# The Plan
Guidelines so everyone is on the same page. Work out ideas and content here before updating pages.

## Structure
* Home (index.html)  
_Landing page, basic overview._  
* About  
_General facts, vision, plan_  
* Get involved  
_Contact info, links,_  


## Content
The website should give a good first impression. It should give people
some idea of what we are about, some description of the project's vision,
and info on how people can get involved if they want to.  We also should
try to convince them that they do want to get involved!

Data Project is to bring members of the community together to learn,
