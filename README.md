# NewportDataProject.github.io

This is the repository for the GitHub pages site for the Newport Data
Project.

## Some Big Changes
The site has gone through some changes under the hood.  Most notably, we're starting to use [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) to
 make it easier to extend the site and keep the look without too much coding overhead in the future.  We're starting by just translating the orignial site, but we should try to leverage some of the nifty things jekyll can do going forward.

Don't forget to check out the [Project Assembly Instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QiE8-CgEUCfH_gUPrWlW871idLk1F0-5mfWXz3T2pec/edit?usp=sharing) for more info on the project direction overall.

# Preview locally with Jekyll
First, install Jekyll.  If you have windows, [these](https://labs.sverrirs.com/jekyll/) are good step by step instructions to get started. For other operating systems, follow [these](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) instructions.

Navigate to this repository on your machine in the console, and run `jekyll serve -w`. Open up a browser and go to `localhost:4000`, and you should see the site.
