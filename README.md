# NewportDataProject.github.io

This is the repository for the GitHub pages site for the Newport Data Project.

We're running this as an open project, so feel free to fork the repository and build up the site.

GitHub supports [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) natively, so the current plan is to get the site set up using it, instead of hand-coded html.
