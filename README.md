# NewportDataProject.github.io

This is the repository for the GitHub pages site for the Newport Data
Project.

# Some Big Changes
The site has gone through some changes under the hood.  Most notably, we're starting to use [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) to
 make it easier to extend the site and keep the look without too much coding overhead in the future.  We're starting by just translating the orignial site, but we should try to leverage some of the nifty things jekyll can do going forward.

Don't forget to check out the [Project Assembly Instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QiE8-CgEUCfH_gUPrWlW871idLk1F0-5mfWXz3T2pec/edit?usp=sharing) for more info on the project direction overall.

# Content
The website should give a good first impression. It should give people
some idea of what we are about, some description of the project's vision,
and info on how people can get involved if they want to.  We also should
try to convince them that they do want to get involved!
